\arguments{
\item{type}{type of palette: \code{"cat"} for categorical (aka qualitative), \code{"seq"} for sequential, \code{"div"} for diverging, and \code{"bivs"}/\code{"bivc"}/\code{"bivd"}/\code{"bivg"} for bivariate (seq-seq, seq-cat, seq-div, and uncertainty-seq). For \code{c4a_gui} it only determines which type is shown initially.}

\item{n, m}{for univariate palettes, \code{n} is the number of displayed colors. For bivariate palettes \code{"biv"}, \code{n} and \code{m} are the number of columns and rows respectively. If omitted: for \code{"cat"} the full palette is displayed, for \code{"seq"} and \code{"div"}, 9 colors, and for \code{"bivs"}/\code{"bivc"}/\code{"bivd"}/\code{"bivg"} 4 columns and rows. For \code{c4a_gui} it only determines which number of colors initially.}

\item{series}{Series of palettes to show. See \code{\link{c4a_series}} for options. By default, \code{"all"}, which means all series. For \code{c4a_gui} it only determines which series are shown initially.}

\item{cvd.sim}{color vision deficiency simulation: one of \code{"none"}, \code{"deutan"}, \code{"protan"}, \code{"tritan"}}

\item{sort}{column name to sort the data. For column names, see details. Use a \code{"-"} prefix to reverse the order.}

\item{text.format}{The format of the text of the colors. One of \code{"hex"}, \code{"RGB"} or \code{"HCL"}.}

\item{text.col}{The text color of the colors. By default \code{"same"}, which means that they are the same as the colors themselves (so invisible, but available for selection). \code{"auto"} means automatic: black for light colors and white for dark colors.}

\item{range}{vector of two numbers that determine the range that is used for sequential and diverging palettes. Both numbers should be between 0 and 1. The first number determines where the palette begins, and the second number where it ends. For sequential palettes, 0 means the leftmost (normally lightest) color, and 1 the rightmost (often darkest) color. For diverging palettes, 0 means the middle color, and 1 both extremes. If only one number is provided, this number is interpreted as the endpoint (with 0 taken as the start). By default, it is set automatically, based on \code{n}. See \code{c4a_gui}, or the internal functions \code{cols4all::default_range_seq} and \code{cols4all::default_range_div} to see what the automatic values are.}

\item{include.na}{should color for missing values be shown? \code{FALSE} by default}

\item{show.scores}{should scores of the quality indicators be printed? See details for a description of those indicators.}

\item{columns}{number of columns. By default equal to \code{n} or, if not specified, 12. Cannot be higher than the palette}

\item{verbose}{should messages and warnings be printed?}
}
\description{
Graphical user interface to analyse palettes. \code{c4a_table} shows a table that can be opened in the browser. \code{c4a_gui} is a graphical user interface (shiny app) around this table. The package \code{kableExtra} is required for \code{c4a_table} and for \code{c4a_gui} the pacakges \code{shiny} and \code{shinyjs}.

\section{Table Columns}{


\tabular{lll}{
\strong{Column            } \tab \strong{Name} \tab \strong{Description} \cr
Max n \tab \code{"nmax"} \tab Maximum number of colors (\code{"cat"} only) \cr
Colorblind-friendly \tab \code{"cbfriendly"} \tab Is it color-blind friendy? \cr
Harmonic palette \tab \code{"harmonic"} \tab Are the colors in harmony with each other? \cr
Intense colors \tab \verb{"highC} \tab Are there any intense (saturated) colors? \cr
Hue type \tab \code{"hueType"} \tab How many different hue ranges are used? For a sequential (\code{"seq"}) palette we consider three classes. 1) "single hue" where one hue is used, which is recommended for quantitative analysis. This is indicated by a paint brush icon 2) "spectral hue" where a wide range of hues are used, e.g. a rainbow palette. This less suitable for quantitative analysis but better to read different colors. This is indicated by a rainbow icon 3) a trade-off between the two mentioned classes (no icon used). For a diverging (\code{"div"}) palette, we also consider similar three classes. 1) "two hues", where one hue is used for the left wing and one for the right wing. 2) "spectral hue" and 3) trade-off. \cr
Ranking \tab \code{"rank"} \tab Ranking of palettes taking the above into account

\section{Color-blind-friendliness indicators}{


\tabular{lll}{
\strong{Indicator            } \tab \strong{Name} \tab \strong{Description} \cr
Minimum distance \tab \code{"min_dist"} \tab Minimum distance between any two colors for any color vision deficiency type. This is a measure to which extend categorical palettes (type \code{"cat"}) are suitable for people with color vision deficiency \cr
Minimum step \tab \code{"min_step"} \tab Minimum distance between two neighboring colors in a sequential (\code{"seq"}) or diverging (\code{"div"}) palette, for any color vision deficiency type. The larger, the better. \cr
Maximum step \tab \code{"max_step"} \tab Maximum distance between two neighboring colors in a sequential (\code{"seq"}) palette, for any color vision deficiency type. For sequential palettes that score the same on \code{"min_step"}, the ones with lower \code{"max_step"} values are slightly preferable, because this means that the distances between neighboring colors is more homogeneous. \cr
Inter-wing-distance \tab \code{"inter_wing_dist"} \tab Minimum distance between any color in the left wing to any color in the right wing of a diverging (\code{"div"}) palette, for any color vision deficiency type. The larger, the better. \cr
}

Color-blind friendliness scores are calculated as:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cat"} \code{min_step}
\item \code{"seq"} \code{min_step} - \code{max_step} / 1000
\item \code{"div"} min(\code{inter_wing_dist}, \code{min_step} * 2)
}

Note: these formulas are in development, and may change in the near future. Suggestions are welcome (via github issues).

\section{General indicators}{


We use the HCL color space, where H is the hue, C the chroma and L the lightness. See the \code{colorspace} package (that is used under the hood) for details.

\tabular{lll}{
\strong{Indicator            } \tab \strong{Name} \tab \strong{Description} \cr
Chroma max \tab \code{"Cmax"} \tab Maximum chroma value. We have set the threshold for the label "intense colors" at 100. \cr
Hue width \tab \code{"Hwidth"} \tab The width/range of hue values that are used. For instance, if a palette has hue values 100, 140, and 220, the Hwidth is 120. Since hues are provided in degrees, a hue width close to 360 means that many hues are used (e.g. in a rainbow palette). The primary use is to determine the hue type (see above). \cr
Hue width L \tab \code{"HwidthL"} \tab Same, but only for the left wing of the palette (useful for diverging palettes) \cr
Hue width R \tab \code{"HwidthR"} \tab Same, but only for the right wing of the palette (useful for diverging palettes) \cr
Luminance range \tab \code{"Lrange"} \tab The range of luminance values of the colors. The smaller, the better for a what we call harmonic palette. However, this is at the expense of having distinguishable colors (which contribute to color-blind-friendliness). \cr
Chroma range \tab \verb{"Crange} \tab The range of chroma values of the colors. Like \code{"Lrange"}, the lower the better. \cr
Lum/Chr range \tab \code{"LCrange"} \tab Defined as max(2 * \code{Lrange}, \code{Crange}), and used to label a palette "harmonic". This formula is determined by some trial-and-error, so suggestions for improvement are welcome.
