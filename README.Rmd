# Colors for all!

The **cols4all** is an R package in development for selecting color palettes. "Color for all" refers to our mission that colors should be usable for not just people with normal color vision, but also for people with color vision deficiency. This package contains palettes from several popular color palette series, such as Color Brewer, Viridis, and Kovesi, but also the lesser known [palettes from Paul Tol](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/). Own palettes series can be added as well. Color palettes are well organized. Currently we support three types: *categorical* (qualitative) palettes, *sequential* palettes, and *diverging* palettes. In the near future, more palette types will be added, namely *cyclic*, *bivariate*, and *hierarchical*. 


## Installation

**cols4all** will be available on CRAN soon! Until then it can be installed using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mtennekes/cols4all")
```

```{r}
getwd()
devtools::load_all(".")
```

## Get started

Navigation through the color palettes is easy:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(cols4all)
c4a_gui()
```

![sequential palettes)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2444081/155185615-9356443d-8a18-40a6-bc9e-d2e0d8e26eb4.png)
![diverging palettes)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2444081/155185638-3d05a045-c794-4eab-b994-88c0b58196e2.png)


Selecting a palette is easy. Palette names are in the format <series>.<palette_name>. So all letters are in small caps, and underscores are used to separate words.

```{r}
# Select the palette "kelly" with 7 colors
c4a("kelly", 7)

# find names of hcl palettes that are diverging
c4a_palettes(type = "div", series = "hcl")

# select purple green palette from the hcl series:
c4a("hcl.purple_green", 11)

# get the associated color for missing values
c4a_na("hcl.purple_green")
```



## Related R packages

The foundation of this package is another R package: [**colorspace**](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/). We use this package to analyse colors. For this purpose, we also use [**colorblindcheck**](https://github.com/Nowosad/colorblindcheck).

There are a few features that distinguishes **cols4all** from other (great) color palette packages, in particular [**pals**](https://kwstat.github.io/pals/) and [**paletteer**](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/paletteer):

* Colors for missing values are made explicit. For this, either a greyscale color that is already contained in the palette is used, or a greyscale color is selected that is distinguisable, also for people with color vision deficiency.

* Palettes are made consistent with each other. For instance, sequential palettes (except for spectral/rainbow palettes) all start with the lightest color and end with the darkest color. Furthermore, black and white are removed from most categorical palettes for practical reasons: white or light grey is almost always used as background color and black for annotation.

* With the gui (see below), a user is able to analyse characteristics of color palettes, such as color-blind-friendliness, harmony, and the presence of intense colors.

* It will be possible to submit an own series of color palettes.

There will be native support for **ggplot2** and **tmap** (as of the upcoming version 4)
